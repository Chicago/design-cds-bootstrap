			<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>
			This document provides a high-level list of current City standards for its hardware and software environments and is intended primarily for City department and vendor use. These standards do not mean that other software and hardware, which might have been previously listed as standard, may not be used or supported, but the following items should be purchased for any new initiative or growth/replacement needs. City departments will need to determine if the standard hardware/software item has been deployed in their department, if required for a new initiative.
