# design-cds-bootstrap

Welcome to the Chicago Design System as a Bootstrap 4 theme, with associated media for creating Internet applications.

This repository is a simple Jekyll website [hosted on Github Pages here](https://chicago.github.io/design-cds-bootstrap/), with a reference user interface implementation of different primitive elements. This will grow over time.

In this repository Bootstrap is included as a GitHub submodule, so a specific Bootstrap 4 version may be compiled into our CSS master file. For this work I chose v4.3.1.


## Thanks & Inspiration

Thanks to [Freddy Heppell's article](https://freddyheppell.com/2018/06/22/using-bootstrap-4-with-jekyll) for suggesting use of Git Submodules. It keeps my hands clean of copying and pasting files all over the internet like a robot.

Thanks to Alexander Rechsteiner of Hacker Themes for the inspiration for [the primitives list on one screen](https://github.com/HackerThemes/theme-kit), and a solid set of reference media.
